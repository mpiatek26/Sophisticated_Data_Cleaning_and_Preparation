# Sophisticated_Data_Cleaning_and_Preparation

1. Introduction
In my project, I emphasize the importance of data quality for machine learning. I've focused on data preprocessing to transform raw, noisy data into a structured format that boosts model accuracy and efficiency.

2. Handling Missing Values
Dealing with missing data is a standard part of data science. In my analysis, I've developed strategies to visualize and manage missing data effectively.

2.1 Visualizing Missing Data
I've utilized various visual tools to better understand the missing data's patterns in the dataset.

2.1.1 Matrix
I've introduced a nullity matrix to quickly assess the completeness of the data across columns.

2.1.2 Correlation Heatmap
My use of a heatmap reveals dependencies between features based on their missing values.

2.1.3 Dendrogram
I've used dendrograms to visualize and interpret the hierarchical clustering of data based on nullity.

2.1.4 Simple Numerical Summaries
I've computed numerical summaries to quantitatively analyze missing data, identifying critical areas of concern.

2.2 Methods to Handle Missing Data
I've applied several techniques including data deletion, encoding, and imputation to handle missing values in the dataset.

2.2.1 Deletion of Data
I've selectively removed data with high levels of missing values to maintain the dataset's integrity.

2.2.2 Encoding Missingness
In my approach, missingness is encoded as an informative category within discrete attributes.

2.2.3 Imputation Methods
I've implemented methods such as KNN, tree-based, and linear imputation to estimate missing values with precision.

3. Encoding Categorical Attributes
I've tackled the challenge of converting categorical variables into numerical values, exploring both standard and advanced techniques.

3.1 Supervised Encoding Methods
These methods allow me to encode categorical variables using the output data as a guide.

3.1.1 Likelihood Encoding
I measure the impact of categorical levels on the output and use this for encoding, employing log-odds to map each category.

3.1.2 Target Encoding
I've adopted target encoding, which averages the output variable by category, for its simplicity and effectiveness.

Suggestions Moving Forward:

3.1.3 Deep Learning Methods
I suggest using deep learning models like embeddings to capture the categorical data's complex patterns.

3.2 Approaches for Novel Categories
I propose a strategy to handle novel categories in future data by introducing a "other" category, ensuring our model's adaptability.
